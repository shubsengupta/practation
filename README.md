# Practation - The best way to practive your presentation

Practation is a smart cue-card that helps you practice, rehearse and present.

Using a somewhat-hacky, somewhat reverse-engineered version of Google's beta Web Speech Api, this app listens to users as they present and provides insight on words/sentences they missed or mispronounced, things they said out of place, and even will prompt the user on the next few words if they're stuck (to help with memorization).
